## Kinda done

- Added server from Server A1 but did not have time to merge it in with the functionality of the app
- Gonna submit with this anyway because it's part of the account page of the app
- P.S. the app was ideally supposed to be working for both offline and online but there was no time so it's only currently available in offline mode
- Refer to SERVER_FEATURES.md for more

## Done

- Anchors (to make virtual objects appear to stay in place in the AR scene)
- Camera flip button (removed as redundant for the app)
- HDR light estimation
- Simple shadows for different furniture items

- IconMaker (used to create 2D icon images from 3D models of the furniture)
- Made the furniture's orientation relative to device camera's orientation (furniture will always look the same when placed no matter where the device camera is facing)
- 1 finger for translating furniture items
- 2 fingers for rotating furniture items
- Click on arrow or swipe to open or close panel of furniture
- Highlighting of previously selected furniture with orange border around selection
- Browse section for the user to find new furniture
- Saved section for the user to save furniture for future usage

- Undo button (undo last transformation applied to the placed furniture item)
- Reset button (remove all transformations applied to the placed furniture item)
- Redo button (redo...)
- Share button (share screenshot of the app without the UI [screenshot only shows what the device camera is showing])

- Audio (music and sounds)
- UI with animations
- Usage of anchors, relative scaling and more to ensure UI layout remains relatively constant throughout devices of different aspect ratios and resolutions
- Various screens

## Maybe

- simple checks for whether furniture of a certain category can be placed and feedback for them
- environment probes
- furniture inspector (supports rotating and scaling of preview models)
- adjust and put back features
- multiple furniture items
- audio vol control
- lesson notes
- receive then clear (when connected to server)
